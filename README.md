Projects using an Adafruit SSD1351 1.5" OLED.
Demos use the Adafruit EYE SPI ribbon connector & breakout board connected to a Raspberry Pi Pico.
One demo is just rectangle graphics with text in the center.
The other runs the wiggly eyeball code, since I've used a display like this in the Mad Eye Project.
That project uses Arduino code, but the Pico 2W is fast enough to do a fine job moving an eyeball for similar build if you want to attempt it.
